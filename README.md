# Video Meet Interface

Video Meet Interface is a project I designed to facilitate seamless online meetings using the Jitsi API. The interface allows users to join video conferences while incorporating special URL parameters to designate an admin who has control over camera and microphone settings. Additionally, the interface includes a dedicated chat feature where only the admin can write messages while other users can view them. To enhance user experience, the project incorporates configurable automessages stored as categories and subcategories, allowing for easy customization and scalability without the need to modify the entire codebase. This project showcases my expertise in integrating APIs, creating user-friendly interfaces, and implementing flexible features.
